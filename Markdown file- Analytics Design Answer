*Analytics Design Answer

***According to the HEAP analytical framework, I would like to record the following user behaviour: 

***The User-level properties such as the region user traffic is coming from, which would allow me to analyse the type of content being consumed in different areas, 
allowing for more relevant content creation for the reader. 

***I would then record session-level properties such as amount of time a user spends on the homepage before moving on to a different part of the website- 
which would be able to identify whether readers log on with no prior motives, or if they had a specific article they wanted to read before accessing the app.  

***Lastly, I would record first touch properties such as the first time a user ever accessed the app, and whether they came from another app or website. 
It would assist in recording whereabouts traffic is coming from.

*** 3.) The dataflow for a cancellation/refund would start with the user logging into their account using their username and password. 
They would then access their personal account from the homepage, where they would view their booking history.  

***The user would then choose the event they would like to cancel from the event history list, and an alert would pop-up to confirm if they were sure of the cancellation, 
with the options of yes and no. 
They would re-confirm the cancellation by clicking ‘yes’, and a screen affirming the refund amount and timeframe, would be displayed as the final step.
